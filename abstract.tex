Page segmentation is a web page analysis process that divides a page  
into cohesive segments, such as sidebars, headers, and footers. 
Current page segmentation approaches use either the DOM,
textual content, or rendering style information of the page.
However, these approaches have 
a number of drawbacks,
such as a large number of parameters and rigid assumptions about the page,
which negatively impact their segmentation accuracy.
We propose a novel page segmentation approach 
based on visual analysis of localized adjacency regions.
It combines DOM attributes and visual analysis to build features of a given page 
and guide an unsupervised clustering.
We evaluate our approach,
implemented in a tool called \toolname,
on 35 real-world web pages,
and examine the effectiveness and efficiency of segmentation.
The results show that, compared with state-of-the-art, \toolname achieves
an average of 156\% increase in precision and 249\% improvement in F-measure.
